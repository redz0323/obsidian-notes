[[Object]] Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of **classes** and **objects**. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.

Four Pillars of OOP:
* [[Inheritance]]
* [[Encapsulation]]
* [[Abstraction]]
* [[Polymorphism]]

I consider OOP as the Holy Grail of Software Engineering as most if not all design principles and best practices are taking advantage of one or more OOP pillars.
