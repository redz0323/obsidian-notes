# Class
- Is a detailed description, the definition, and the template of what an object will be. Not the [[Object]] itself.
- It is a user-defined data type, that holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.
- It is the blueprint of any [[Object]].
