# Parallelism
- Doing lots of work by dividing it up among multiple threads that run concurrently.
- Multiple tasks or subtasks of the same task that literally run at the same time on a hardware with multiple computing resources like multi-core processor.
- Achieving [[Concurrency]] by distributing work across multiple CPUs.
- Parallelism and [[Concurrency]] are similar but not identical.
